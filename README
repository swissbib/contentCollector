contentCollector is used by swissbib  to collect all the data processed and provided by swissbib.

The procedure of "Collection" is arbitrary and can be done through various channels

Currenly supported are:

1) OAI-Harvesting
2) Push - mechanism via file interface
3) Pull mechanism via WebDav

The channel for OAI is based on the Python library for OAI clients (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyoai)


The main use case for swissbib:
 - collect the data
 - make various pre - processing (e.g. skip not well formed XML content)
 - provide the collected and pre-processed content our data hub (CBS) for further processing using a defined interface
 (currently this is a simple "file API")
 The whole process is configurable via XML files.

This main use case could be enhanced via PlugIns

  swissbib developed a plugin to store the pre-processed raw content into a data store. (we are using a Mongo database for this purpose).
    This gives us the flexibility to access at any time the raw content of the repositories for our purposes.
    Another possibility could be to handover the raw content into a message queue (like RabbitMQ or Apache ActiveMQ) to push the content reliable into
     further channels (beside the swissbib CBS data hub)


Todo:
- better modularization of the python code
        -> better separation inside core functionality
           and better separation between core functionality and additional tools (e.g. utilities for administration of the data store -> Mongo)
- better documentation, currently
    http://www.swissbib.org/wiki/index.php?title=Members:HarvestingInfrastructure
    http://www.swissbib.org/wiki/index.php?title=Members:UseOfHarvestingInfrastructure
    (both partially outdated)
- currently only XML content is processed - could be enhanced
- remove the code originally developed to skip content delivered by repositories but not suitable for swissbib purposes based on calculated hash-values.
   Background: Some repositories deliver content we don't want (might happen...) - e.g. the availability status changed but not the underlying bibliographic record
   (we are working with online availability)
    -> and refactor this functionality as an additional plugin.
    One can see looking at this example that we developed the component step by step for our purposes.
- provide a pre-packaged Python deployment with the necessary libraries already included

- .... ideas are welcome!
